# en600.468-inflect
In this assignment, your task is to take a sequence of Czech lemmas and produce the correct
inflection for each of them. Since [the data used in the
assignment](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt2.0/) is licensed under the LDC, the assignment is written
to require an account on the CLSP servers. Please contact Matt Post if you would like information on
how to extract the PDT information from your own copy of the [LDC
catalog](http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T01).
